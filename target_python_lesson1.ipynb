There are six small sections explaining the basics of Python (specially for version 3.6).\n\nThis guide was written for a Jupyter Notebook which is an interactive note taking app for code. As seen below, code sections are seperated off and can be run by clicking run (or selecting the content of the cell and with `ctrl` + `Enter` keys).\n\nPython is an interpreted language and you can start the interpreter to run the commands. There are multiple version of the Python interpreter, we will be using Python v3. Most of what you will learn will also work in Python v2.\n\n# 1: Think of Python as a Calculator\n\n### 1.1 Variables & Data Types\n\nVariables store information. I can store the word \"cat\" in the variable named \"animal\". I use the actual text \"animal\" (variable name) in my code and refer the value \"cat\" which is what is stored in the computer's memory. There are quite a few types of variables such as numbers, letters, lists, etc. Each type of variable is called a Data Type."

The standard math operators precedence does apply to Python, [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence) you can find a full table.

Functions always return something.\n\nTo define a function, use `def`, a name for the function, and then (if you want) parameters. At the end of this line, make sure you use a colon (`:`).
