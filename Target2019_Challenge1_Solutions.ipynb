Have each level's list in one big list (i.e. `pascals_triangle = [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [etc.]]`). You cannot just write `[1,3,3,1]` in your code, you must find it through an algorithm.\n\nYou can append a list after you have created it. For example,\n\n```\npascals_triangle = [[1]]\n\npascals_triangle.append([1,1])\npascals_triangle.append([1,2,1])\n\nprint(pascals_triangle)\n```\n\n![Pascal's Triangle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)\n\n## Solution\n\nWrite below your solution.\nHere prinited are few lines form the pascals_triangle variable.\n\n```\npascals_triangle[0] # Should return\n[1]\npascals_triangle[1] # Should return\n[1, 1]\npascals_triangle[2] # Should return\n[1, 2, 1]\n\n# All the way to\npascals_triangle[9] # Should return\n[1, 9, 36, 84, 126, 126, 84, 36, 9, 1]\n```"
